# clccam

Go bindings for the CLC Cloud Application Manager (https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/)

### Getting started

Download from inside your `$GOPATH`:
```bash
> go get -d  github.com/grrtrr/clccam
```

Try some of the examples in the `examples/` folder. These illustrate individual API calls.

**FIXME**: the `examples/` folder does not yet exist. PRs welcome ;-)
